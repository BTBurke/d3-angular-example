d3-angular-example
==================

An example of using D3.js and Angular.js together.  I outline how this code works in a [post on my blog](http://1000monkeys.co/2012/12/30/using-d3-with-angular.html).

You can also see a working example [here](http://examples.1000monkeys.co/d3-angular-bars/#/).

This example uses [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) as a build environment.  One you clone this repo you can run `yeoman server` to get a local installation running.
